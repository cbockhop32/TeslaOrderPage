        title: 'Glass Roof',
        details: 'The expansive Glass Roof provides passengers with a brighter, more spacious experience and a seamless view of the sky. Infrared and ultraviolet light is effectively blocked before entering the cabin, reducing heat and glare even when the sun is directly overhead.'

        title: 'Center Display',
        details: 'Access everything on the expansive 15-inch touchscreen including high-definition side and rearview camera views, navigation, movies, music, games and more. Your surroundings are visualized in real time while you drive to display speed limit signs, upcoming traffic control signals, pedestrians, cyclists and hazards in a 360-degree surround view.'

        title: 'All Vegan Interior',
        details: 'Softer than leather, yet far more durable and more stain-resistant, our custom-engineered seating material is fully vegan and significantly more sustainable than traditional seating materials, maximizing comfort and esthetics while maintaining our rigorous standards for durability and stain resistance.'
    },
    {
        img: interior5,
        title: 'Advanced Climate Controls',
        details: 'Airflow and temperature are controlled entirely through the display, allowing precise direction without ever seeing or touching a physical vent. On hot days, Cabin Overheat Protection ensures interiors always stay cool. In cold weather, pre-conditioning automatically warms the cabin and prepares the car’s battery to maximize range and efficiency.'

        title: 'Basic Autopilot',
        details: 'Included with every Tesla, Autopilot enables your car to steer, accelerate and brake automatically for other vehicles and pedestrians within its lane. Advanced safety and convenience features are designed to assist you with the most burdensome parts of driving, alongside driver assistance features such as emergency braking, collision warning and blind-spot monitoring.'

        title: 'Easy Charging',
        details: 'Charge anywhere there is electricity. Most range used for daily driving can be topped off using the included Mobile Connector Bundle and a 110V household outlet, or upgrade to a 220V Tesla Wall Connector for the best home charging experience. For long distance travel, Model 3 adds up to 175 miles of range in just 15 minutes using Tesla’s Supercharger network, getting you back on the road, sooner.'

        title: 'Sentry Mode',
        details: 'A unique layer of protection for Tesla vehicles continuously monitors the environment around the car when it’s left unattended. When enabled, Sentry Mode enters a “Standby” state, like many home alarm systems, which uses the car’s external cameras to help detect and protect against potential threats.'

        title: 'Expansive Storage',
        details: 'Model 3 features 15 ft³ of cargo space accessible through both the front trunk and the automatically opening and closing rear trunk. Taking advantage of the space traditionally occupied by bulky engines, gas tanks and transmissions, the design of Model 3 enables disproportionately large amounts of storage for a car its size, while bolstering occupant safety through a more spacious, reinforced body and chassis.'
